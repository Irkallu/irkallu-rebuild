pathwaystitle: 'Pathways'
pathwaystext: "Irkallu has two pathways you can choose to follow; the way of the warrior or the way of a creator. That is, you can choose a Battle pathway or a Crafter/Gatherer pathway.

These have no affect on your standing in the guild, but are a nice way of telling other guildmembers what you would like to be known for."

recruitstext: 'Our recruits are new members who have not been with us long. You’ll quickly move up and pick a pathway once you’ve been with us for a little bit and started to settle in.'
